                    <li><b><u>2003-05: Rise to the first team:</u></b></li>
                    <p> During the 2003–04 season, his fourth with Barcelona, Messi rapidly progressed through the club's ranks, debuting for a record five teams in a single campaign.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li><b><u> 2005-08: Making the starting eleven</u></b></li>
                    <p> On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi signed his first contract as a senior team player.</p>
                    <br>
                    <li> <b> <u>2008-09: Winning the sextuple</u></b></li>
                    <p>Barça's prosperity continued into the second half of 2009, as they became the first club to achieve the sextuple, winning six top-tier trophies in a single year.</p>
                        <br>
                        <li> <b><u> 2010-11: Continued success</u></b></li>
                        <p>At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, both times by the greatest voting margin in each trophy's history.</p><br>

                        <li><b><u> 2012: A record-breaking year:</u></b></li>
                        <p>20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.</p><br>

                        <li><b><u>2013-14: Messidependence</u></b></li>
                    <p> Barcelona lost 7-0 on aggregate to Bayern Munchen. These matches gave credence to the notion of Messidependencia, Barcelona's perceived tactical and psychological dependence on their star player.</p><br>

                    <li><b><u>2015: A historic treble</u></b></li>
                    <p> Messi capped off the year by opening the scoring in the 36th minute of the 2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final on 20 December, collecting his fifth club trophy of 2015 as Barcelona went on to defeat River Plate 3–0 in Yokohama, and winning the tournament's Silver Ball, despite missing the semi-final.</p><br>

                    <li><b><u>Ballon d'Or</u></b></li>
                    <p> Ballon d'Or/FIFA Ballon d'Or: 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015, 2019, 2021</p><br>

                    <li><b><u>FIFA World cup 2022</u></b></li>
                    <p> The 2022 World Cup final has been regarded by many as the greatest game in the competition's history. Lionel Messi scored twice on a night that will be etched in his memory forever as it was that night when his place at the pinnacle of football history was sealed! Well, at least for now.

                        He won the Golden Ball for being the best player of the tournament for his seven goals and three assists in seven matches and with that became the first player in World Cup history to score in the group stage, round of 16, quarter-final, semi-final and final in a single edition of the tournament.
                        <br><br>
                        In his nineteen previous appearances at four FIFA World Cup tournaments (2006-2018), Messi had scored just six goals and none of them was scored at the knockout stages.
                        <br><br>
                        He has been directly involved in 21 goals at the World Cup for Argentina (13 goals, 8 assists), the outright most of any player for any nation at the finals on record (since 1966).
                        <br><br>
                        Moreover, with his assist against Mexico in the group stage, he is now both the youngest (18y 357 days against Serbia & Montenegro in 2006) and the oldest (35y 155 days vs Mexico today) player to both score and assist in a single World Cup game since 1966.
                        <br><br>
                        Germany, South Africa, Brazil, Russia and now Qatar, the little magician has assisted in five countries across four continents. Phew!
                        <br><br>
                        Lionel record-breaking Messi!</p>
